In this case, the population is all 200 employees, and the sample is random because each employee has an equal chance of being chosen.\n"

Translation: n refers to the number of objects from which the permutation is formed; and r refers to the number of objects used to form the permutation. Consider the example from the previous paragraph. The permutation was formed from 3 letters (A, B, and C), so n = 3; and the permutation consisted of 2 letters, so r = 2."
