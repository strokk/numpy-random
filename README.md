### SUMMARY ABOUT THE NUMPY.RANDOM INVESTIGATION


  This assignment concerns an investigation on the numpy.random package and documenting it using jupyter notebook.

  For gathering all the necessary information to complete this assignment I used as an guideline the original SciPy.org documentation on random sampling. [1]


  From there I have used Jupyter notebook [2] to proceed with my investigation , and in case you require assistance installing and running Jupyter notebook to read this investigation, please follow the instructions on the reference link. [3]

  On my investigation, I started explaining the purpose of the numpy.random package and it’s use, following by the use of the “simple random data” and “permutations” functions.

  I have also gone through an analysis of five of the distributions functions provided by numpy.random package, giving examples and its correlations between each other. 

  And finally an investigation on the importance and the use of seeds while generating pseudorandom numbers (GPRN).
